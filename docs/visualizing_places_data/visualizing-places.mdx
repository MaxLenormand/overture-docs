# Visualising Overture Places Data in Rapid



### Part 1: Starting Rapid

Simply navigate to https://rapideditor.org/edit to open Rapid v2. 

Zoom in using the + or - hotkeys, the mouse scroll wheel, etc. to an area where you want to see Overture places data. 

Click the 'Map Data' sidebar button or hit the 'F' hotkey. Then, click the three dots icon next to 'Custom Data'. 

![Map Data Panel in Rapid](/img/visualizing_places_data/visualizing-places.png)

You will see the Custom Data dialog. Paste this URL: 

`https://r2-public.protomaps.com/overture-tiles/2023-10-19-alpha.0/places.pmtiles`

into the text input and hit 'OK'. 

Wait a few moments, and you should see some places data start to show up on the map. These places are clickable, and inspectable:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="buildings" label="Buildings" default>

1. Query the buildings theme using Amazon Athena and download the results as a CSV file, `buildings.csv`:

    ```sql
    SELECT class,
        TRY(FILTER(names.common, x -> x.language = 'local')[1].value) as local_name,
        height,
        level,
        CAST(sources AS JSON) as sources,
        ST_ASTEXT(ST_GeomFromBinary(geometry)) as geometry_wkt
    FROM overture_2023_10_19_alpha_0
    WHERE theme = 'buildings' AND type = 'building'
        AND bbox.minX > -122.679404 AND bbox.maxX < -121.978275
        AND bbox.minY > 47.360619 AND bbox.maxY < 47.786336
    ```


2. Use DuckDB to convert `buildings.csv` into a GeoJSONSeq file.

    <details><summary>DuckDB Query ( <code>SQL</code> )</summary>

    ```sql
    COPY (
        SELECT
            "class",
            "local_name",
            "height",
            "level",
            "sources",
            ST_GeomFromText(geometry_wkt) as geometry
        FROM read_csv('csv/buildings.csv', header=True,
            COLUMNS={
                'class':'VARCHAR',
                'local_name':'VARCHAR',
                'height':'DOUBLE',
                'level':'VARCHAR',
                'sources':'VARCHAR',
                'geometry_wkt':'VARCHAR'
            }
        )
        ) TO 'geojson/buildings.geojsonseq'
    WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'GeoJSONSeq');
    ```
    </details>

3. Run [tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe) to produce a `pmtiles` archive from `buildings.geojsonseq`

    ```bash
    tippecanoe -o tiles/buildings.pmtiles -Z13 -z13 -l buildings -P geojson/buildings.geojsonseq
    ```

    <details><summary>Tippecanoe flag explanation</summary>

    - `-o tiles/buildings.pmtiles` is our output file.
    - `-Z13` and `-z13` will produce a tileset starting at zoom 13 and going up to zoom 13 (so only 1 zoom level).
    - `-l buildings` names the layer "buildings"
    - `-P` allows tippecanoe to read the file in parallel. Since we created a GeoJSON sequence file instead of a single GeoJSON Feature Collection, tippecanoe can process the input data more efficiently.

<TabItem value="roads" label="Roads" default>

1. Query the transportation theme using Amazon Athena and download the results as a CSV file, `roads.csv`:

    ```sql
    SELECT
        level,
        JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(road, '$.class') AS road_class,
        JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(road, '$.roadNames.common[0].value') AS road_name,
        sources[1].dataset AS source,
        ST_ASTEXT(ST_GeomFromBinary(geometry)) as geometry_wkt
    FROM overture_2023_10_19_alpha_0
    WHERE theme = 'transportation' AND type = 'segment'
        AND bbox.minX > -122.679404 AND bbox.maxX < -121.978275
        AND bbox.minY > 47.360619 AND bbox.maxY < 47.786336
    ```

2. Use DuckDB to convert `roads.csv` into a GeoJSONSeq file.

    ```sql
    COPY (
        SELECT
            road_class as class,
            road_name as name,
            level,
            ST_GeomFromText(geometry_wkt) as geometry
        FROM 'csv/roads.csv'
        ) TO 'geojson/roads.geojsonseq'
    WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'GeoJSONSeq');
    ```

3. Run [tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe) to produce a `pmtiles` archive from `roads.geojsonseq`

    ```bash
    tippecanoe -o tiles/roads.pmtiles -Z10 -B10 -z13 -l roads -P geojson/roads.geojsonseq
    ```

    <details><summary>Tippecanoe flag explanation</summary>

    - `-o tiles/roads.pmtiles` is our output file.
    - `-Z10` and `-z13` will produce a tileset starting at zoom 10 and going up to zoom 13.
    - `-B10` will ensure that all featuers are present from zoom level 10.
    - `-l roads` names the layer "roads"
    - `-P` allows tippecanoe to read the file in parallel. Since we created a GeoJSON sequence file instead of a single GeoJSON Feature Collection, tippecanoe can process the input data more efficiently.
