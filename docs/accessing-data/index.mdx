title: Getting Overture data
---

Overture's data releases are distributed as geoparquet files available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You do not need an AWS or Azure account to access the data.

The data is available at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/` |


Our friends in the Overture developer community have made repackaged and repartioned verstions of our  data available 


Read the [Overture Data Schema Reference](https://docs.overturemaps.org/reference) to understand the Overture Data Schema and see the [`overturemaps/data`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) Github repository for information on the latest release.
