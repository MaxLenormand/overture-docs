title: Getting Overture data
---

Overture's data releases are distributed as geoparquet files available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You do not need an account with either of these services to access the data.

The data is available at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/` |

Read the [Overture Data Schema Reference](https://docs.overturemaps.org/reference) to understand the Overture Data Schema and see the [`overturemaps/data`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) Github repository for information on the latest release.
