 In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use AWS Athena and [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl) to query the Overture buildings theme and explore the primary data sources of the Overture buildings in Hyderabad, India.

 ## Query the data in AWS Athena


 ```sql
SELECT id, theme, class, CAST(sources AS JSON) AS sources, sources[1].dataset AS primary_source, CAST(names AS JSON) AS names, ST_GeomFromBinary(geometry) AS geometry
FROM overture
WHERE theme='buildings'
    AND type='building'
    AND  bbox.minx > 78.4194
        AND bbox.maxx < 78.5129
        AND bbox.miny > 17.3427
        AND bbox.maxy < 17.4192
 ```

 Download the results as a CSV file.
