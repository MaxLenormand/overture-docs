## Official Overture Data Releases

Overture's data releases are distributed as geoparquet files available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You do not need AWS or Azure accounts to access the data.

The data is available at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/` |


## Parquet Schema

The Parquet files match the Overture Data Schema for each theme with the following enhancements:

- The `id` column contains unique identifiers in the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) format.
- The `bbox` column is a `struct` with the following attributes: `minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, `maxY`. This column allows you to craft more efficient spatial queries when running SQL against the cloud.
- The `geometry` column is encoded as WKB (the files are geoparquet).

Read the [Overture Data Schema Reference](https://docs.overturemaps.org/reference) to understand the Overture Data Schema and see the [`overturemaps/data`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) Github repository for additional information on the latest release.
