Welcome to Overture Maps how-to guides and tutorials.

Overture Maps data releases are distributed as parquet files available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You do not need an account with either of these services to access the data.

The data is publicly available at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/` |

See the [`overturemaps/data`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) Github repository for information on the latest release and read the [Overture Data Schema Reference](https://docs.overturemaps.org/reference) to understand the Overture Data Schema.
